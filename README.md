# SASS shadows without images

## What is this?
A bunch of CSS classes and SASS mixins for creating resolution-independent crisp and visually appealing shadows without using any images.

## Can I see a demo?
Yup, here: http://ahrengot.com/web-development/css-shadows-without-images/

## How do I use these?
*As a SASS mixin:*
    div {
        @include shadow('curved');
    }

*Using the CSS class names:*
    <div class="shadow curved"></div>
